# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Our Commitment
The Aethel Project is dedicated to providing a hardened, sovereign substrate for AI agents. We take the security of our users and their data with the utmost seriousness. In the 2026 landscape of autonomous agents, we believe that security is a collaborative effort.

## 🏁 Supported Versions
We currently only support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 📨 Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a potential security flaw in Aethel, please report it through the following secure channels:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR):** Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of this repository. This is our preferred method as it allows for private coordination and the eventual assignment of a CVE.
2. **Encrypted Email:** Send a detailed report to `security@aethel-project.local` (Note: Ensure you encrypt your message using our PGP Key: `[PASTE_YOUR_PGP_FINGERPRINT_HERE]`).

### What to Include in Your Report
To help us triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include:
- A descriptive title for the vulnerability.
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Details of the environment (OS, Rust version, Aethel version).

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
We ask that you follow these principles of responsible disclosure:
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it publicly (we aim for a 30-90 day window depending on complexity).
- Do not attempt to access, modify, or exfiltrate any user data that is not your own.
- Avoid any testing that could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) for other users.

## 🎁 Bug Bounty
While Aethel is an open-source project, we are currently working with the **Sovereign Network** to establish a USDC-based bounty pool for critical RCE (Remote Code Execution) and Data Leak vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for official updates.
